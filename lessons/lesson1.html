    <!--Notice how I didn't declare the DOCTYPE. 
        It looks like I also forgot to close my
        </html> element and entirely forgot my
        <head></head> element! But its ok,
        the html parsing enegine automatically
        places them into the file for you so
        don't run into "syntax errors" while
        displaying html documents on browser! --><body>
    <h1>Try opening the Developer Console!</h1>
    <h1>Press <code>ctr + shift + c</code> or <code>ctr + shift + i</code></h1>
    <h3>(You may have to use a different (non-school) google account)</h3>
</body>
<!--Indentation doesn't matter either, but
    it is considered good "style" to indent
    everything properly. Try playing around
    with html files to see what you can do. -->
